# LocalNoise

LocalNoise is an Android app that I have been working on for awhile now. The app gets the users closest city/metro area and shows upcoming concerts/shows in their area for the coming weeks. The user can then export the upcoming shows to a Spotify playlist with a touch of a button. Also the users can then get details on each individual concert/show and its respective artists. Users can see their last played setlist and can export the setlist to a spotify playlist to listen to before the show.

The idea behind this was that I love going to shows but sometimes bands that I know aren't playing in my area at the time. With this I can just export a playlist, listen to it throughout the week and see if I find a band I like. If I find a band, I can easily export their last playlist to get an idea of what songs they have been playing and then go to the show :metal:. I open sourced this because I'm not trying to make any money and just want to create an app that I find useful and learn some stuff along the way.

So when will it be ready for the Google Play Store?.....soon I hope :neutral_face:
